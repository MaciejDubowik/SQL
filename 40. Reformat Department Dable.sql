# Table: Department

# +-------------+---------+
# | Column Name | Type    |
# +-------------+---------+
# | id          | int     |
# | revenue     | int     |
# | month       | varchar |
# +-------------+---------+
# In SQL,(id, month) is the primary key of this table.
# The table has information about the revenue of each department per month.
# The month has values in ["Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"].
 

# Reformat the table such that there is a department id column and a revenue column for each month.

# Return the result table in any order.

# The result format is in the following example.


# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT 
    id,
    SUM(IF(month = 'Jan', revenue, null)) AS Jan_Revenue,
    SUM(IF(month = 'Feb', revenue, null)) AS Feb_Revenue,
    SUM(IF(month = 'Mar', revenue, null)) AS Mar_Revenue,
    SUM(IF(month = 'Apr', revenue, null)) AS Apr_Revenue,
    SUM(IF(month = 'May', revenue, null)) AS May_Revenue,
    SUM(IF(month = 'Jun', revenue, null)) AS Jun_Revenue,
    SUM(IF(month = 'Jul', revenue, null)) AS Jul_Revenue,
    SUM(IF(month = 'Aug', revenue, null)) AS Aug_Revenue,
    SUM(IF(month = 'Sep', revenue, null)) AS Sep_Revenue,
    SUM(IF(month = 'Oct', revenue, null)) AS Oct_Revenue,
    SUM(IF(month = 'Nov', revenue, null)) AS Nov_Revenue,
    SUM(IF(month = 'Dec', revenue, null)) AS Dec_Revenue
